                                        A must for all fans of vampire/exploitation cinema/17th-century French drama crossover novels!!</p>
                                    <p>
                                        It's 1930s Hollywood, and Nick de Blegny is a vampire on a mission. This town just doesn't get it. Jean Racine, now he really
                                        knew how to tell a story. What the movies need is more Ph√®dre.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        So what if the studios are giving Nick the bum's rush? He has his minion; he has his genius - and exploitation movies are
                                        crying out for a creative type who knows how to save a buck or three. Who needs actors,
                                        when this burg is chockful of stock footage, just waiting to be snapped up and put
                                        to good use?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The only good thing about actors is their celebrity - and Nicky D, the man who invented celebrity culture back when he was
                                        still warm - knows how to turn a pretty profit: by selling extra-special blood to
                                        the more discerning vampires. Everything's coming up roses - so long as he can stay
                                        ahead of gangsters - both warm-blooded and vampiric - and keep from being once again
                                        rudely interrupted by the local gendarmes...
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Meet Nick de Blegny: self-styled genius; acknowledged father of PR; and the greatest physician, adventurer, huckster, and
                                        vampire that 17th-century France ever produced. As he'll be the first to tell you.
